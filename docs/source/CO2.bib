	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{FOS}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{LUC}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{G}$_{\textrm{ATM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{LAND}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{B}$_{\textrm{IM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater}1{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{σ}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{LUC}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries' climate progress.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}For the year 2020, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{FOS}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} declined by 5.4 \% relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (9.3 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.5 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} when the cement carbonation sink is included), and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{LUC}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} was 0.9 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.7 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, for a total anthropogenic CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emission of 10.2 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.8 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (37.4 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 2.9 GtCO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Also, for 2020, {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{G}$_{\textrm{ATM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} was 5.0 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.2 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (2.4 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.1 ppm yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} was 3.0 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.4 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{LAND}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} was 2.9 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 1 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, with a {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{B}$_{\textrm{IM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.8 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. The global atmospheric CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021 suggest a rebound in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{FOS}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} relative to 2020 of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}4.8 \% (4.2 \% to 5.4 \%) globally.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and datasets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this dataset (Friedlingstein et al., 2020, 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

	abstract = {A vector space structure is proposed for the set of ﬁnite games with ﬁxed numbers of players and strategies for each players. Two statical equivalences are used to reduce the dimension of ﬁnite games. Under the vector space structure the subspaces of exact and weighted potential games are investigated. Formulas are provided to calculate them. Then the ﬁnite evolutionary games (EGs) are considered. Strategy proﬁle dynamics is obtained using diﬀerent strategy updating rules (SURs). Certain SURs, which assure the convergence of trajectories to pure Nash equilibriums, are investigated. Using the vector space structure, the projection of ﬁnite games to the subspace of exact (or weighted) potential games is considered, and a simple formula is given to calculate the projection. The convergence of near potential games to an ε-equilibrium is studied. Further more, the Lyapunov function of EGs is deﬁned and its application to the convergence of EGs is presented. Finally, the near potential function for an EG is deﬁned, and it is proved that if the near potential function of an EG is a Lyapunov function, the EG will converge to a pure Nash equilibrium. Some examples are presented to illustrate the results.},

The relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions is considered as one of the most important empirical relationships. However, rigorous economic causal analysis of the tradeoff between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and economic growth for credible climate change policies is still limited. The purpose of this research is to develop and apply the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to predict GDP based on CO2 emissions. The ELM results are compared with genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN). The reliability of the computational models was accessed based on simulation results and using several statistical indicators. Coefficients of determination for ELM, ANN and GP methods were 0.9271, 0.8756 and 0.4475, respectively. Based upon simulation results, it is demonstrated that ELM can be utilized effectively in applications of GDP forecasting.},

There is bidirectional causality between GDP and energy consumption for Japan, unidirectional causality running from GDP to energy consumption for Italy, and unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to GDP for the resource country Canada. Moreover, the results also show a bidirectional time-varying causality between energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the United States, and causality from energy consumption to CO2 emissions for France. Finally, while we find significant time-varying causalities running from GDP to CO2 emissions for Italy and Japan, the finding of inverted N-shaped curves (Italy and Japan) lends no support to the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for these countries. It implies that environmental policy and economic growth should go hand in hand. Other policy implications of the empirical results have been proposed.},

	abstract = {Given the vast uncertainty surrounding climate impacts, meta-analyses of global climate damage estimates are a key tool for determining the relationship between temperature and climate damages. Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefﬁcient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufﬁcient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we ﬁnd strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases ﬂatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature ({\textgreater}4 ◦C) damage estimates. Replacing the DICE-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature–damage relationship, we ﬁnd a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 SCC relative to DICE, depending on the treatment of productivity. When catastrophic impacts are also factored in, the SCC increases by four- to ﬁve-fold.},

Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim for 3.5 °C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climate–Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates. To determine economically ‘optimal’ climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly, we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2 °C (or 1.5 °C) target.},

	abstract = {Integrated assessment models are tools largely used to investigate the benefit of reducing polluting emissions and limiting the anthropogenic mean temperature rise. However, they have been often criticized for their underlying assumptions, often leading to low levels of abatement. Countries and regions that are generally the actors in these models are usually depicted as having standard concave utility functions in consumption. This, however, disregards a potentially important aspect of environmental negotiations, namely its distributive implications. The present paper tries to fill this gap assuming that countries/regions have Fehr and Schmidt (The Quarterly Journal of Economics 114(3):817–868, 1999) (F\&S) utility functions, specifically tailored for including inequality aversion. By adopting the RICE model, we compare its standard results with the ones obtained introducing F\&S utility functions, showing that, under optimal cooperation, the level of temperature rise is lower in the last scenario. In particular, the peak temperature, reached in 2155 under standard assumptions and one or two decades later under F\&S preferences with, respectively, heterogeneous and homogeneous F\&S inequality aversion parameters (α and β), is of 2.86 ∘C in the former scenario and of 2.65 ∘C and 2.67 ∘C in the latter two. Furthermore, it is shown that potentially stable coalitions are easier to be achieved when F\&S preferences are assumed. However, potentially stable coalitions are far from reaching environmental targets close to limiting the mean temperature rise below 2 ∘C despite the adoption of F\&S utility functions. The 2 ∘C target is almost achieved in all scenarios when the payoffs in the F\&S utility function are given by the per-capita consumption rather than utility of consumption, with F\&S preferences and heterogeneous F\&S inequality aversion parameters leading to a peak temperature rise of 2.04 ∘C.},

We apply the PAGE model to assess the merits of policies to prevent global warming (by controlling the emissions of greenhouse gases), and policies to adapt to any global warming that occurs. The results confirm that it is difficult to overcome the problem of global warming by taking preventive action alone. The argument for introducing an aggressive adaptive policy is very strong. We calculate the valuation that would have to be placed upon non-economic environmental and social impacts, for a combined strategy of preventive and adaptive policies to be considered a worthwhile option, both for individual regions and for the world as a whole. We also show that uncertainties in all four groups of inputs to the model (scientific, costs of control, costs of adaptation and valuation of impacts) have a great influence on the costs and impacts of the combined strategy.},

This paper gives two plausible risk aversion axioms that a reduced form utility function of temperature change and the capacity to produce consumption might reasonably be required to satisfy. These axioms indicate that the standard-practice multiplicative specification of disutility damages from global warming, as well as its additive analogue, are special cases of this paper's theoretically derived utility function. Empirically, the paper gives some numerical examples demonstrating the surprisingly strong implications for economic policy of the distinction between additive and multiplicative disutility damages.},

Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to develop new projections of trends and impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results with those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if major climate-change policies are not taken. It suggests that it is unlikely that nations can achieve the 2°C target of international agreements, even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed. (JEL Q54, Q58)},

Nonetheless, the damage functions employed in integrated assessment models that aim at studying the economics of climate change usually are based solely on the absolute temperature increase. Hence, these models neglect additional damages that will occur if the rate of temperature increase exceeds a certain threshold that overstrains the adaptive capacities of ecological and social systems. In the present paper, we implement such rate-related damages in the well-known integrated assessment model DICE-2016R. Using the resulting model variant DICE-RD, we show for several scenarios that an insufficient climate policy that ignores rate-related damages can lead to substantial economic losses.},

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change. One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first published in Nordhaus (1992), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2017a). A difficulty in assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study find that the major revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the environmental changes have been much smaller. Particularly sharp revisions have occurred for global output, damages, and the social cost of carbon. These results indicate that the economic projections are the least precise parts of IAMs and deserve much greater study than has been the case up to now, especially careful studies of long-run economic growth (to 2100 and beyond).},

The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors-agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor-increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality.

Countries can tailor the UN SDGs to their priorities and situations, but the urgency in their planned actions to combat climate change and its impact is affected by the form of uncertainty surrounding their decisions. Following a Choquet-Brownian process to model ambiguity aversion on the dynamics of environmental damage, we study an international pollution control problem where countries may behave cooperatively or non-cooperatively. We show that carbon emissions decrease, as perceived ambiguity increases, in keeping with the precautionary principle, and such decrease is lower if countries behave non-cooperatively. We also examine the interrelation between the precautionary principle and the effects of a declining social discount rate and increase in population, and find that optimal policies induce more precaution. Our results have important implications for national strategies and actions to combat climate change.},

They also estimate the global damage potential for each gas—the ratio of the social cost of the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas to the social cost of carbon dioxide. For all gases, they find the social costs and damage potentials sensitive to alternative assumptions. The global damage potentials are compared to global warming potentials (GWPs), a key metric used to compare gases. The authors find that global damage potentials are higher than GWPs in nearly all sensitivities. This finding suggests that previous papers using GWPs may be underestimating the relative importance of reducing noncarbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions from a climate damage perspective. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of results to carbon dioxide fertilization, which notably reduces the social cost of carbon dioxide, but only has a small effect on the other gases. As a result, the global damage potentials for methane and nitrous oxide are much higher with carbon dioxide fertilization included, and higher than many previous estimates.},

It is the purpose of this paper to bring some clarity to these subjects. The paper follows Hood in describing policy-makers in democratic polities as highly risk-averse and therefore unlikely to take policy action unless the circumstances and the nature of the problem they face are propitious. It also suggests that when actions are taken these are not always ‘positive’ – that is oriented towards dealing with the objective manifestations of a problem – but can also be ‘negative’ – that is, geared towards denial of a problem or its rejection. The paper examines the literature on policy failure and success in order to isolate several dimensions of failure which decision-makers would like to avoid. It then combines these elements to construct a two stage model of decision-making which identifies which types of problems and circumstances are likely to lead to innovative activity and which are not. This model is then applied to the case of activities for climate change mitigation and adaptation.},

This formula, which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many percent of the output ﬂow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, as well as the paths of technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on, all disappear from the formula. We ﬁnd that the optimal tax should be a bit higher than the median, or most well-known, estimates in the literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change. We ﬁnd coal—rather than oil—to be the main threat to economic welfare, largely due to its abundance. We also ﬁnd that the costs of inaction are particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability of different energy sources and technological progress.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the socially optimal pricing of carbon emissions over time when climate-change impacts are unknown, potentially high-consequence events. The carbon price tends to increase with income. But learning about impacts, or their absence, decouples the carbon price from income growth. The price should grow faster than the economy if the past warming is not substantial enough for learning the true long-run social cost. It grows slower than the economy as soon as the warming generates information about events that could have arrived but have not done so. A quantitative assessment shows that the price grows roughly at the rate of the economy for the next 100 years.},

	abstract = {Governments and policymakers around the world put their best efforts to control the pollutions and climate change. Thus, they set various regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon footprints. It is expected that firms should follow these regulations while maintaining their profitability. In this regard, firms can manage their carbon emissions across their supply chain (SC) by inventory management, since operational adjustments may affect the amount of carbon emissions, such as changing the production quantity and the frequency of transportations. This study applies a Stackelberg game between the government and a multi-stage green supply chain (GSC), in which the government’s goal is to maximize social welfare and that of the GSC is to minimize its cost. First, we formulate the inventory cost and carbon emission of a multi-stage GSC under two decision-making structures: non-coordinated and coordinated GSCs. Second, we develop eight bi-level mathematical programming models considering the structure of the GSC and the regulations of the government including carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon trade, and carbon offset. Then two solution approaches will present for solving problems based on the type of the GSC structure. This study examines the effect of coordination and carbon regulations on inventory cost, carbon emission and the objective function of the government.},

However, game theory has been criticized for being too theoretical, abstracting from too many practical problems and being based on very specific assumptions. This article tries to qualify this critic. First, it lays out the fundamental assumptions underlying the game theoretical analysis of international environmental problems. Second it summarizes important findings which help to explain the difficulties of cooperation and discusses remedies. Chapter 3 looks at measures to avoid asymmetric welfare distributions and to enforce an IEA. Chapter 4 discusses policy instruments in global pollution control and chapter 5 summarizes the results on the formation of coalitions. Third, the results of chapters 3, 4 and 5 are critically reviewed. On the one hand, open issues with respect to the theoretical analysis are characterized. On the other hand, practical problems which are not covered by theory are mentioned and evaluated as to their effect to influence policy conclusions. Fourth, the theoretical results and the derived conclusions of chapters 3 to 5 are applied to the analysis of the Kyoto-Protocol (chapter 6). The article stresses the intuition behind all results, though formal proofs of new results are given.},

	abstract = {Computing the Nash equilibrium (NE) for N −player non-zerosum stochastic games is a formidable challenge. Currently, algorithmic methods in stochastic game theory are unable to compute NE for stochastic games (SGs) for settings in all but extreme cases in which the players either play as a team or have diametrically opposed objectives in a two-player setting. This greatly impedes the application of the SG framework to numerous problems within economics and practical systems of interest. In this paper, we provide a method of computing Nash equilibria in nonzero-sum settings and for populations of players more than two. In particular, we identify a subset of SGs known as stochastic potential games (SPGs) for which the (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium can be computed tractably and in polynomial time. Unlike SGs for which, in general, computing the NE is PSPACE-hard, we show that SGs with the potential property are P-Complete. We further demonstrate that for each SPG there is a dual Markov decision process whose solution coincides with the MP-NE of the SPG. We lastly provide algorithms that tractably compute the MP-NE for SGs with more than two players.},

Most approaches to climate change are based in economics and environmental science; in this book, Parkash Chander argues that we can make further progress on the climate change impasse by considering a third approach—game theory.Chander shows that a game-theoretic approach, which offers insight into the nature of interactions between sovereign countries behaving strategically and the kinds of outcomes such interactions produce, can illuminate how best to achieve international agreements in support of climate-change mitigation strategies. Game Theory and Climate Change develops a conceptual framework with which to analyze climate change as a strategic or dynamic game, bringing together cooperative and noncooperative game theory and providing practical analyses of international negotiations. Chander offers economic and game-theoretic interpretations of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement and argues that the Paris Agreement may succeed where the Kyoto Protocol failed. Finally, Chander discusses the policy recommendations his framework generates, including a global agreement to support development of cleaner technologies on a global scale.},

On one hand, they suggest that the prospects for effective climate cooperation are bleak: The standard view is that stable coalitions are small and that renegotiation-proof equilibria require that only a few countries participate. On the other hand, there might be light at the end of the tunnel after all. First, more recent work suggests that larger coalitions can be made stable. Second, other recent work suggests that it may be possible to design a renegotiation-proof climate agreement with broad or even full participation. Third, deposit-refund systems might help solve some of the obstacles for effective climate cooperation. Fourth, although the “law of the least ambitious program” pinpoints severe constraints on effective cooperation, this law has its limits. Fifth, countries may use cooperative probes to build trust. Sixth, cooperation might emerge in a completely decentralized fashion. Finally, experiments indicate that some of the conditions for effective cooperation that are taken for granted in most formal models might in fact be overly strict.},

Is there something in such a call for leadership? In two steps, this article provides an empirically informed answer to that question. The first part develops a theoretical account of the relation between leadership and cooperation in international climate change mitigation policy (ICCMP). Starting from a five-dimensional leadership account and a simple game-theoretical analysis of the impediments to cooperation, it is predicted that (1) increased leadership facilitates cooperation in ICCMP and (2) different leadership modes contribute to cooperation in varying degrees. The second part tests these hypotheses: a new leadership index measures the extent to which the EU exhibited leadership at the negotiations of the Conference of the Parties (COP) between 1995 and 2008. This positively correlates with the level of cooperation arrived at. The result also holds for four out of five leadership modes.},

Coalitions form as soon as a minimal set of players ﬁnd it is either convenient or necessary to join a coalition, last for some more or less long periods of time and then may either widen or shrink so that a coalition becomes an empty shell and lose its reason of being. Keeping a coalition active for long periods of time requires both the use of resources to keep the members convinced that the coalition is useful and the continuous presence of the problem that caused the rising of the coalition. Such resources are necessary for the communication among the members and the sharing of resources, beneﬁts and costs under the form of side payments. A hidden assumption is that members interact repeatedly with time so that their past knowledge of past interactive attitudes can be used in current interactions so to favour either co-operative or competitive attitudes.},

Based on John von Neumann's radically new logical ideas for a stored program computer using William's cathode ray tube technology as a storage device, an Electronic Computer Project was established in 1946 at the IAS. The latter half of 1954 was a busy period of assembling the new group, preparing the computer program for the IAS three-level (900,700, and 400 mbar) quasigeostrophic model, and setting up an operational system for receiving and processing data and for disseminating results. The IBM 701 was delivered early in 1955 and the first 36 hour forecast was produced from 1500Z April 18, 1955 initial conditions. From 1960 onward, subsequent developments, both in numerical weather prediction and in general circulation and climate modeling were exponential in their growth and significance.},

	abstract = {Reduction of carbon emissions is of paramount importance in the context of global warming and climate change. Countries and global companies are now engaged in understanding systematic ways of solving carbon economics problems, aimed ultimately at achieving well defined emission targets. This paper proposes mechanism design as an approach to solving carbon economics problems. The paper first introduces carbon economics issues in the world today and next focuses on carbon economics problems facing global industries. The paper identifies four problems faced by global industries: carbon credit allocation (CCA), carbon credit buying (CCB), carbon credit selling (CCS), and carbon credit exchange (CCE). It is argued that these problems are best addressed as mechanism design problems. The discipline of mechanism design is founded on game theory and is concerned with settings where a social planner faces the problem of aggregating the announced preferences of multiple agents into a collective decision, when the actual preferences are not known publicly. The paper provides an overview of mechanism design and presents the challenges involved in designing mechanisms with desirable properties. To illustrate the application of mechanism design in carbon economics, the paper describes in detail one specific problem, the carbon credit allocation problem.},

This article presents an analysis of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is robust to a range of assumptions. We show that increasing uncertainty is necessarily associated with greater expected damages from warming, provided the function relating warming to damages is convex. This constraint is unaffected by subjective or cultural risk-perception factors, it is unlikely to be overcome by the discount rate, and it is independent of the presumed magnitude of climate sensitivity. The analysis also extends to “second-order” uncertainty; that is, situations in which experts disagree. Greater disagreement among experts increases the likelihood that the risk of exceeding a global temperature threshold is greater. Likewise, increasing uncertainty requires increasingly greater protective measures against sea level rise. This constraint derives directly from the statistical properties of extreme values. We conclude that any appeal to uncertainty compels a stronger, rather than weaker, concern about unabated warming than in the absence of uncertainty.},

Principal empirical elements in the experiment are the intensity of the heating, the value of the vertical stability, and the type of frictional dissipation. The flow patterns which develop are quite realistic, including a jet and zonal surface westerlies in middle latitudes, and the growth of a large disturbance. The associated energy transformations are investigated, and demonstrate the important role of the disturbance in the development of the zonal currents. The meridional circulation is also studied, together with its contribution to the zonal momentum budgets of the lower and upper halves of the atmosphere. Truncation errors eventually put an end to the forecast by producing a large fictitious increase in energy.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Simple climate models can be valuable if they are able to
replicate aspects of complex fully coupled earth system models. Larger
ensembles can be produced, enabling a probabilistic view of future climate
change. A simple emissions-based climate model, FAIR, is presented, which
calculates atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and effective
radiative forcing (ERF) from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone and other
agents. Model runs are constrained to observed temperature change from 1880
to 2016 and produce a range of future projections under the Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The constrained estimates of
equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), transient climate response (TCR) and
transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are 2.86
(2.01 to 4.22) K, 1.53 (1.05 to 2.41) K and 1.40 (0.96 to
2.23) K (1000 GtC)−1 (median and 5–95 \% credible intervals). These are
in good agreement with the
likely Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
range, noting that AR5 estimates were derived from a combination of climate
models, observations and expert judgement. The ranges of future projections
of temperature and ranges of estimates of ECS, TCR and TCRE are somewhat
sensitive to the prior distributions of ECS∕TCR parameters but less
sensitive to the ERF from a doubling of CO2 or the observational
temperature dataset used to constrain the ensemble. Taking these
sensitivities into account, there is no evidence to suggest that the median
and credible range of observationally constrained TCR or ECS differ from
climate model-derived estimates. The range of temperature projections under
RCP8.5 for 2081–2100 in the constrained FAIR model ensemble is lower than
the emissions-based estimate reported in AR5 by half a degree, owing to
differences in forcing assumptions and ECS∕TCR distributions.},

	abstract = {This is the ﬁrst part of a series of two articles analyzing the global thermal properties of atmosphere–ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs) within the framework of a two-layer energy-balance model (EBM). In this part, the general analytical solution of the system is given and two idealized climate change scenarios, one with a step forcing and one with a linear forcing, are discussed. These solutions give a didactic description of the contributions from the equilibrium response and of the fast and slow transient responses during a climate transition. Based on these analytical solutions, a simple and physically based procedure to calibrate the two-layer model parameters using an AOGCM step-forcing experiment is introduced. Using this procedure, the global thermal properties of 16 AOGCMs participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are determined. It is shown that, for a given AOGCM, the EBM tuned with only the abrupt 43CO2 experiment is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the temperature evolution in both a step-forcing and a linear-forcing experiment. The role of the upper-ocean and deep-ocean heat uptakes in the fast and slow responses is also discussed. One of the main weaknesses of the simple EBM discussed in this part is its ability to represent the evolution of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance in the transient regime. This issue is addressed in Part II by taking into account the efﬁcacy factor of deepocean heat uptake.},

Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased West–East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Niños, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within ≈1°C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than ≈1°C, relative to 2000, will constitute “dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.},

	title = {Transport and storage of {C02} in the ocean -- -- an inorganic ocean-circulation carbon cycle model},
	abstract = {Inorganic carbon in the ocean is modelled as a passive tracer advected by a three-dimensional current field computed from a dynamical global ocean circulation model. The carbon exchange between the ocean and atmosphere is determined directly from the (temperature-dependent) chemical interaction rates in the mixed layer, using a standard CO2 flux relation at the air-sea interface. The carbon cycle is closed by r coupling the ocean to a one-layer, horizontally diffusive atmosphere. Biological sources and sinks are not included. In this form the ocean carbon model contains essentially no free tuning parameters. The model may be regarded as a reference for interpreting numerical experiments with extended versions of the model including biological processes in the ocean (Bacastow R and Maier-Reimer E in prep.) and on land (Esser G et al. in prep.). Qualitatively, the model reproduces the principal features of the observed CO2 distribution in the surface ocean. However, the amplitudes of surface pCO2 are underestimated in upwelling regions by a factor of the order of 1.5 due to the missing biological pump. The model without biota may, nevertheless, be applied to compute the storage capacity of the ocean to first order for anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In the linear regime, the response of the model may be represented by an impulse response function which can be approximated by a superposition of exponentials with different amplitudes and time constants. This provides a simple reference for comparison with box models. The largest-amplitude ({\textasciitilde}0.35) exponential has a time constant of 300 years. The effective storage capacity of the oceans is strongly dependent on the time history of the anthropogenic input, as found also in earlier box model studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The responses of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other climate variables to an emission pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere are often used to compute the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature change Potential (GTP), to characterize the response timescales of Earth System models, and to build reduced-form models. In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project, which spans the full model hierarchy, we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm, 25 ± 9\% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 ± 12\% and the land the remainder (16 ± 14\%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 ± 0.12 °C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000, temperature decreases only slightly, whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential, given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. This value very likely (5 to 95\% confidence) lies within the range of (68 to 117) × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2. Estimates for time-integrated response in CO2 published in the IPCC First, Second, and Fourth Assessment and our multi-model best estimate all agree within 15\% during the first 100 yr. The integrated CO2 response, normalized by the pulse size, is lower for pre-industrial conditions, compared to present day, and lower for smaller pulses than larger pulses. In contrast, the response in temperature, sea level and ocean heat content is less sensitive to these choices. Although, choices in pulse size, background concentration, and model lead to uncertainties, the most important and subjective choice to determine AGWP of CO2 and GWP is the time horizon.},

An essential requirement of such a model is to reproduce typical global surface temperature and atmospheric CO2 responses displayed by more complex Earth system models (ESMs) under a range of emission scenarios, as well as an ability to sample the range of ESM response in a transparent, accessible and reproducible form. Here we adapt the simple model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) to explicitly represent the state dependence of the CO2 airborne fraction. Our adapted model (FAIR) reproduces the range of behaviour shown in full and intermediate complexity ESMs under several idealised carbon pulse and exponential concentration increase experiments. We ﬁnd that the inclusion of a linear increase in 100-year integrated airborne fraction with cumulative carbon uptake and global temperature change substantially improves the representation of the response of the climate system to CO2 on a range of timescales and under a range of experimental designs.},

	title = {{FaIRv2}.0.0: {A} generalized impulse response model for climate uncertainty and future scenario exploration},
	volume = {14},

	doi = {10.5194/gmd-14-3007-2021},
	abstract = {Here we present an update to the FaIR model for use in probabilistic future climate and scenario exploration, integrated assessment, policy analysis, and education. In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas (GHG) metric calculations in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from CMIP6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more complex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased “hot” or “cold”: it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated FaIR model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that FaIR can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.},
